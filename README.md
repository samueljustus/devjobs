  ## My process

i used Vite to start my react app. and tailwind for the styling of the app.
for managing states i used react context api and then i used react-form-hook and the react-form-context to build out the form
i then integrated paystack api for the payment gateway

### built with 


- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

i learnt how the paystack api works and i figured out how to implement it in thus project

### Continued development

moving on i'll pick up how to use redux for complex state management and writing codes with react framework (Nextjs)

### Useful resources

- [react.dev](https://www.example.com) - This helped me learn context api. for some reason the docs is the est place to learn react
- (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-forms-in-react-using-react-hook-form/) - was really struggling with react-hook-form concept but this blog post helped simplify it.
